## Introduction

Binary decision trees are a fundamental data structure used in game theory to model sequential decision-making processes. In this repository, we provide a basic implementation of binary decision trees in the C programming language. Each node in the tree represents a decision point, with branches leading to different possible outcomes.

## Usage

To use this implementation, you can clone the repository and compile the provided C files. Here's how to get started:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GameTheoryDecisionTree.git
   cd GameTheoryDecisionTree
Compile the source files (assuming you have GCC installed):

2. Compile the source files (assuming you have GCC installed):

```shell
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 main.c decision_tree.c -o decision_tree
```

3. Run the executable:
	

```shell
./decision_tree
```

## Implementation Details
The implementation includes functions for creating nodes, inserting decisions, printing the tree structure, and freeing allocated memory. It demonstrates a simple way to build and traverse binary decision trees for educational purposes.

	
## Examples
Here's an example of how the decision tree might be constructed and printed:

 ```shell

#include "decision_tree.h"

int main(void)
{
    decision_tree_t *root;

    // Create the root decision
    root = create_node("Start Game");

    // Build the tree (add more decisions and outcomes as needed)

    // Print all decisions
    print_decisions(root);

    // Free the allocated memory
    free_tree(root);

    return 0;
}
```
